			<p>Alex Catalan's personal freelance website. Showcases some of his work and people he's been inspired by. This website shows off good visual flow, but lacks a nav bar for the user to jump through the content back and forth. It has a couple of untitled sections, however, they're all nav elements.</p>

			Passed, only got one error that was very minor.

			<p>Adidas Group "Herzo" is a website showcasing the living enviroment of the Adidas headquarters. From my perspective I find the website to be very confusing. Even though it's general "click here for more info, the websit feels static. Code wise they used a couple of "style" tags that could be replaced in the css. Within the html tag I found a ton of "classes" embedded. It has two untitled sections which I assume are the upper nav and middle nav. </p>

			Did not pass. Needs to fix some the proper langues code.

			<p>A portfolio website by Marc Hinse ( I think ). Very well done website with only a few untitled sections. I believe they are nav elements. This guy is sick. 19 Total sections and 5 untitled. It has about 36 errors through validation, however 99% of those errors are the repeated "Bad value". Otherwise it's a pretty solid website. </p>



			Did not pass, needs to replace the "i" tags with either em or strong. Also some attribute problems on the language.
